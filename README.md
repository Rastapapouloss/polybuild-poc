## Introduction

In today's fast-paced software development environment, efficiency is key. Polybuild addresses the common challenges associated with traditional build systems. By employing cost-based dependency resolution, this framework ensures that builds are not only faster but also more reliable. 

Polybuild implements deterministic build workflows, providing mathematical guarantees for build integrity. This means that developers can trust the output of their builds, knowing that they are consistent and repeatable.

## Features

- **Single-Pass Compilation**: Eliminate the need for multiple compilation passes.
- **Cost-Based Dependency Resolution**: Optimize the build process by analyzing dependencies based on cost functions.
- **Deterministic Builds**: Ensure that builds produce the same output every time.
- **Component Isolation Protocols**: Maintain separation between components for better stability and performance.
- **Governance-Driven Architecture Management**: Manage architecture with a focus on governance and compliance.
- **Performance Optimization**: Enhance build performance through advanced techniques.

## Getting Started

To begin using Polybuild, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rastapapouloss/polybuild-poc.git
   cd polybuild-poc
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that all required dependencies are installed. Refer to the installation section for details.

3. **Run the Framework**: Execute the framework to see it in action. 

## Installation

To install Polybuild, you will need to have the following prerequisites:

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **NPM**: Node Package Manager comes with Node.js.

### Steps to Install

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd polybuild-poc
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**: After installation, verify that everything is set up correctly.
   ```bash
   npm run verify
   ```

## Usage

Once you have installed Polybuild, you can start using it in your projects. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

### Basic Command

Run the following command to initiate a build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will trigger the build process using the configurations set in your project.

### Advanced Configuration

Polybuild allows for advanced configuration through a configuration file. Create a `polybuild.config.js` file in your project root with the following structure:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  dependencies: {
    componentA: 'path/to/componentA',
    componentB: 'path/to/componentB',
  },
  optimization: {
    enableCaching: true,
  },
};
```

This configuration allows you to define your project dependencies and optimization settings.
